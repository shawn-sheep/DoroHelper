## Support and Encouragement

Zhuyi Yiyi: After the former author [Lao H](https://github.com/kyokakawaii) stopped updating, I have been doing the majority of the maintenance and new feature additions for DoroHelper. This has cost me a significant amount of time and energy, and I hope those who are able can offer some support.
